# ðŸš€ How to Deploy Your App to Vercel (Free & Easy!)

## Option 1: Deploy with Vercel (Recommended - Super Easy!)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code
Your app is already ready to deploy! I've added a `vercel.json` file for you.

**Method A: Using GitHub (Easiest)**
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. In Vercel dashboard, click "New Project"
3. Select your repository
4. Click "Deploy" - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite app!
5. Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes at a URL like `your-app-name.vercel.app`

**Method B: Using Vercel CLI (if you prefer terminal)**
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. In your project folder, run: `vercel`
3. Follow the prompts (just press Enter for defaults)
